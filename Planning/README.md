*Project Planning and Budget*

First thing first is dividing the project down in to digestable tasks for everyone in the group 

Job 1 :
Duck name decoder - ultrasound(UART) communication.
Build an ultrasonic reciever and extract the the UART signal using software to correctly parse the data

Job 2 :
Remote control software and wifi communication.
Build the UI and wifi communication in order to control. 
and also implement the sending of data recieved by the bot's sensors.

Job 3 :
Radio signal and Polarity sensors
Design and build the hardware behind the resonant circuits in order to decern the species of duck

Job 4 : 
Infared signal sensor 
Design and build the hardware behind the resonant circuits in order to decern the species of duck

Job 5 :
Chassis and mechanical design
In charge of designing the chassis and the driver circuit for the motors perhaps also in charge of the power suply

Job 6 : 
System integration and testing 
In charge of writing and compiling the report
and coordinate the integration of the the sensors into the bot
